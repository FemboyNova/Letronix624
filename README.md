Hello
small programming pause. I am currently doing some daily live shows on drums and will return.

so I don't lose track here is my plan when I'm back.
Add collider variables for the object macro then make the add object function add that collider to the collider set of the game layer.
Then add functions to interact with the colliders for like buttons and things.
After that do the same with rigid bodies and make them change the positions of the nodes.
